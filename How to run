Hello marker,

Ensure that server.crt and server.key are in the directory. Otherwise they can be created by running this command in terminal in the directory

openssl req -x509 -newkey rsa:2048 \
  -keyout server.key -out server.crt \
  -days 365 -nodes \
  -subj "/CN=localhost"

These are the instruction to run my program on Turing

1. Open 2 x terminal windows and use cd to bring both of them to this directory
2. ensure that both startCLient.sh and startServer.sh have execution privalige 
3. run ./startServer.sh 
4. You will be asked what port number you would like to host on. In testing i use 2000 due to restrictions in lower ports on linux and not having permissions. If you put a port that it cant host on it will notify
you however you are free to chose whichever port you feel.
5. Once server connects it will display a "Hosting on port (x)"
6. Run ./startCLient.sh and when asked what port you would like to connect to, input the same port you are hosting the server on
7. the client script will then send local host and port number to start Client and a connection will be made if the port numbers are a match and a START GAME message will be sent to the server.
8. Server will begin the game and send a board to the client, client then sends co ordinates to the server and the two scripts go back and forward until all ships have been sunk or a disconnect
9. When all ships are sunk a congratulations message will be sent to the client with the amount of shots taken and the server will drop the connection. Re launch ./startCLient and input the same port number to play again
