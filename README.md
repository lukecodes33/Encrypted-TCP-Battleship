# Encrypted-TCP-Battleship
Client to Server game of Battleship using TCP

This was a project i made in my computer network and security class. The idea is for a client and server script to send messages back and forward
alowing the client to play a game of battleship against the server. Asymmetric encryption is implimented and can be viewed using a program like wireshark.

Future plans for this are to host the server and client on different machines on the network rather than 2 terminals running on the same machine.
